\chapter{Introduction}


This document is a collection of notes relating to the build and installation of the KLyBall D13 Data Separator, based on information gained from members of the OSIWeb.org discussion forums (https://osiweb.org/osiforum/).

The notes and information here specifically apply to a D13 version 2 data separator used in conjunction with a OSI 600D coupled to a 610 expansion card.

Version 2 of the D13 data separator differs from version 1 in that it is ready for dual two sided drives \emph{abcd} or any other combination, and has a motor control circuit if desired. Version 1 needed a modification for dual double sided drives. In addition there is a jumper to disengage the data separation and motor control.

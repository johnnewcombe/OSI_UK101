\chapter{Introduction}

This document describes the build, configuration and calibration of the OSI 502 board, in particular for standalone use with a serial terminal or terminal emulation software.

The 502 board was designed specifically for cassette-based systems and supports OSI ROM Basic. It has five ROM sockets, four for BASIC and one for a 2K monitor ROM that maps 256-byte segments into the memory space via a priority encoder. It uses 2114 RAM chips and can support 8K on board. A 300-baud cassette interface is included using an ACIA and associated analog circuitry. The same ACIA can be used for the on board serial interface. The C2-4P used this board.

This document was created as a series of notes made during the build of a board and is not mean't to be definitive. Most of the information was gathered from the OSIWeb forum and from dealing with issues during the build.

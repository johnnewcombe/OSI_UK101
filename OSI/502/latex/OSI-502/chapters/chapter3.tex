\section{Tape Pulse Duration}

Connect a jumper between Pins 10 and 11 of J2, Cold start Basic and enter...

\begin{verbatim}
    10 Print "U"
    20 GOTO 10
    SAVE
    RUN
\end{verbatim}

With the input of scope connected to pin 5 of U22, adjust R75 for a positive pulse width of at least 500uSec, but not more that 640uSec. Disconnect the jumper.

\section{Memory IC Allocation}

The minimum amount of memory that can be used to start the 502 as a standalone machine at the monitor is 1K (0000--3FFF). The following list shows how each pair of memory chips are addressed.

\begin{verbatim}
    
    U40-U49     0000-03FF
    U39-U48     0400-07FF
    U38-U47     0800-0BFF
    U37-U46     OCOO-OFFF
